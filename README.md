## 🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Model

The architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three progressive layers:

- **🔸 Bronze Layer**:  
  Stores raw data ingested as-is from the source systems (CSV files) into a SQL Server database.

- **⚪ Silver Layer**:  
  Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for reliable analysis.

- **🟡 Gold Layer**:  
  Contains business-ready, denormalized star schema models optimized for analytics and reporting.
